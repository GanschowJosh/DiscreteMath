# DiscreteMath
Small scripts for Discrete Mathematics concepts
## Descriptions:
1. `triominoes.py`: visual proof for proving any 2^n by 2^n chessboard with one square removed can be completely covered by L-shaped triominoes. Uses numpy for matrix manipulation and matplotlib for visualization
2. `Prufer Code Generator.py`: generates a Prufer code for a given tree, also can go in reverse and generate a tree for a given Prufer code
3. `magicSquareChecker.py`: checks if there exists a magic square (a square where the sum of each row, column, and both diagonals is the same) of some permutation of a given list of numbers

And other small projects
